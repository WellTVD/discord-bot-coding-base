# DiscordBot: Base for Heroku
An easy way to start developing your Bot, adapted to work specifically on Heroku. Just fork :)

> **REMEMBER:** If you will use GitHub as a host to your Bot files, **never** set any secret code directly in a public repository. Even using privates CLI's, prefer use the "Config Vars" in Heroku to set all {{GH_BOT...}} values.
